Subject: **Final Reminder: Demise of Dataproc 2.0 Pipelines Scheduled for November 22, 2024**

Dear [Team/Users/Colleagues],

We have previously sent multiple reminders regarding the transition away from Dataproc 2.0, as this version is now officially out of support. Despite these reminders, we still see some active pipelines running on Dataproc 2.0.

Please be advised that all remaining pipelines using Dataproc 2.0 will be permanently decommissioned on **November 22, 2024**. Any pipelines still operating on this version after this date will be disabled, potentially affecting related processes and workflows.

To avoid disruption, we strongly urge you to migrate any remaining pipelines to a supported version of Dataproc as soon as possible. For assistance with the migration process, or if you need additional resources, please reach out to our support team at [support email/contact information].

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
